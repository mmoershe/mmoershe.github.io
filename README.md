# MY GITHUB PAGES REPO

I'm honestly not sure why you are here and reading this, but here is an overview over the projects on this GitHub Pages anyways.  

## Sheet Music Quiz

This is supposed to be a fast-paced quiz about musical notations, with a focus on training or initial reaction to seeing a certain note. The entire point of this quiz to remove the "thinking" when trying to figure what note you are seeing, and instead make the reading process particularly intuitive.  
Although this quiz has two sections (Intervalle und Töne), the latter one is the focus of this project and actually useful lmao
